          This programme is the same as the BSc Computer Science that runs in
          the regular mode. Regular mode is a terminology used in refering to
          the first set of students the approved quota allows. The students are
          taught by the same lecturers and supported by the same Technicians
          with the same laboratories, libaries and other facilities. They also
          have their lectures at the same time as the Regular students and in
          some lectures they sit in the same lecture room with the regular
          students. This programme is introduced for qualified students who
          could not be admitted into the regular stream as a result of the quota
          for the regular students. However, the programme is a fee paying one
          but the fees are far lower than Ghanaian fee-paying students' fees.
          Note that this programme is not a PART-TIME programme. The aims and
          objectives of the parallel programme and the admission requirements
          are the same as that of the regular programme: The aims and objective
          for the running of the programme are as follows: The Department of
          Computer Science offers in-depth training for students with sound
          academic background in Mathematics and Science and who are aspiring to
          become professionals in the field of Information Technology. The
          primary goal of the department is to produce and provide the public
          sector of the nation as well as private organizations and institutions
          with world class Computer Programmers, Computer Analysts, System
          Analysts and Management Information Specialists. The Department also
          offers research opportunities for graduate studies with well- equipped
          computer laboratories and other research facilities. This programme
          opens a window for students who desire to pursue Computer Science at
          KNUST but who cannot be admitted because of the quota for the regular
          stream
          <h2>Admission Requirements</h2>
